            <h2>Understanding Responsiveness</h2>
            <p>If you don't understand responsiveness, let me explain. Responsiveness means that when you open a document on any device, you won't need to scroll horizontally but vertically, making it easier to view and navigate. Let’s move to the code. Here is our code. I will guide you step-by-step on how to create this design. If you follow my steps, you won't face any issues while designing anything.</p>

        <section id="css" class="mb-5">
            <h2>CSS Overview</h2>
            <p>In CSS, I will show you both internal and external CSS. External CSS is usually written in the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> section of the HTML file. I have used the <code>&lt;style&gt;</code> tag here, which is meant for CSS. Anything written within this tag will have CSS properties. Internal CSS is one of the basic tags in HTML. Here’s the <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> section. The content written in the body is what appears on the website, while the head contains meta-information.</p>
            <p>Speaking of meta tags, they are used to define metadata. They usually have a <code>name</code> and <code>content</code> attribute to define the initial scale of a device, making the design look consistent across devices. Let’s move to the design. First, I will show you the blank design, and then we will start coding.</p>

        <section id="designing" class="mb-5">
            <h2>Designing the Layout</h2>
            <p>In web design, boxes are the first and most essential elements. These boxes are adjusted according to devices. This adjustment process is called responsiveness. Media queries are used for this purpose. A responsive design adjusts itself based on the device's dimensions.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="header" class="mb-5">
            <h2>Designing the Header</h2>
            <p>Now, let’s design the header. The header design starts with setting a background color (e.g., white and purple) and text color (e.g., white). Then, we add padding to create space between the text and the box. After writing the header content, we check the design. If there’s a mistake, like padding being too much or too little, we adjust it accordingly.</p>

        <section id="techniques" class="mb-5">
            <h2>Responsive Design Techniques</h2>
            <p>Responsive web designs can be created in 4–5 ways, including using Bootstrap, Flexbox, or CSS Grid. If you use Bootstrap, you simply add pre-defined classes, and the design becomes responsive. However, creating responsiveness manually gives you more control over the design. Flexbox properties allow you to align boxes automatically, whereas CSS Grid lets you divide the layout into rows and columns for precise control.</p>

        <section id="menu" class="mb-5">
            <h2>Designing the Menu</h2>
            <p>Next, we’ll design the menu using a container and align its elements using Flexbox. For each menu item, we add styles, including padding, background color, and hover effects. This makes the menu interactive and visually appealing.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="content" class="mb-5">
            <h2>Designing the Content Section</h2>
            <p>Then, we move on to the content section. It’s structured in paragraphs (<code>&lt;p&gt;</code> tags), and the width is adjusted to ensure that it doesn’t stretch to the edges of the container. Images are also made fully responsive using the <code>width: 100%</code> property.</p>

        <section id="footer" class="mb-5">
            <h2>Designing the Footer</h2>
            <p>For the footer, we set a background color, text color, and padding to give it a neat appearance. If the design doesn’t look good initially, we adjust the spacing and styling until it’s perfect.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="testing" class="mb-5">
            <h2>Testing Responsiveness</h2>
            <p>Finally, we test the responsiveness by resizing the browser or using different devices. If elements break or overflow, we adjust them using media queries. For example, we use <code>max-width: 768px</code> for mobile devices to ensure the layout adapts accordingly.</p>
